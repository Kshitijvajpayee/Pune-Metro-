A simple C++ program using Graph and Priority Queue data structures and Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, etc algorithms to display the shortest distance/path in Pune Metro.

The "Pune Metro Route Finder" is a sophisticated C++ program designed to assist commuters in the Pune Metro system. This project utilizes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to efficiently calculate the fare and shortest metro route between a source station and a destination station within the Pune Metro network.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The program offers a user-friendly interface that allows commuters to input the source and destination stations easily.

Pathfinding Algorithms: It incorporates advanced pathfinding algorithms to calculate the shortest route between the chosen source and destination stations. Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search algorithm are commonly used for this purpose.

Optimized Fare Calculation: The program also calculates the fare for the journey based on the selected source and destination. Fare calculation may consider factors such as distance traveled, type of fare card, and any applicable discounts.

Efficient Data Structures: DSA plays a crucial role in optimizing the pathfinding process. Data structures like graphs, priority queues, and hash tables are efficiently utilized to store and manipulate the metro network data.

Interactive Output: Upon input, the program displays not only the shortest metro route but also additional information such as intermediate stops and estimated travel time.

Expandability: The project is designed with expandability in mind, making it possible to incorporate future updates such as real-time tracking, station announcements, and service alerts.

Project Focus:

The primary focus of this project lies in optimizing pathfinding algorithms for graphs. This optimization ensures that commuters receive the quickest and most efficient routes between Pune Metro stations, enhancing their overall metro experience.

Significance:

Time-Saving: Commuters can save valuable time by choosing the shortest and most efficient routes, especially during rush hours.

Cost-Efficient: The optimized fare calculation helps commuters make informed decisions regarding their travel expenses.

Enhanced User Experience: With an easy-to-use interface and quick response times, this project aims to provide an enhanced and stress-free metro journey.
